## Prerequisites

The IIS site create action uses Web Services for Management, [WSMan], and Windows Remote Management, [WinRM], to create remote administrative sessions. Because of this, Windows Actions Runners, `runs-on: [windows-2019]`, must be used. If the IIS server target is on a local network that is not publicly available, then specialized self-hosted runners, `runs-on: [self-hosted, windows-2019]`, will need to be used to broker commands to the server.

Inbound secure WinRm network traffic (TCP port 5986) must be allowed from the GitHub Actions Runners virtual network so that remote sessions can be received.

Prep the remote IIS server to accept WinRM management calls. In general the IIS server needs to have a [WSMan] listener that looks for incoming [WinRM] calls. Firewall exceptions need to be added for the secure WinRM TCP ports, and non-secure firewall rules should be disabled. Here is an example script that would be run on the IIS server:

```powershell
$Cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -CertstoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\My -DnsName <<ip-address|fqdn-host-name>>

Export-Certificate -Cert $Cert -FilePath C:\temp\<<cert-name>>

Enable-PSRemoting -SkipNetworkProfileCheck -Force

# Check for HTTP listeners
dir wsman:\localhost\listener

# If HTTP Listeners exist, remove them
Get-ChildItem WSMan:\Localhost\listener | Where -Property Keys -eq "Transport=HTTP" | Remove-Item -Recurse

# If HTTPs Listeners don't exist, add one
New-Item -Path WSMan:\LocalHost\Listener -Transport HTTPS -Address * -CertificateThumbPrint $Cert.Thumbprint â€“Force

# This allows old WinRm hosts to use port 443
Set-Item WSMan:\localhost\Service\EnableCompatibilityHttpsListener -Value true

# Make sure an HTTPs inbound rule is allowed
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Windows Remote Management (HTTPS-In)" -Name "Windows Remote Management (HTTPS-In)" -Profile Any -LocalPort 5986 -Protocol TCP

# For security reasons, you might want to disable the firewall rule for HTTP that *Enable-PSRemoting* added:
Disable-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Windows Remote Management (HTTP-In)"
```

- `ip-address` or `fqdn-host-name` can be used for the `DnsName` property in the certificate creation. It should be the name that the actions runner will use to call to the IIS server.
- `cert-name` can be any name. This file will used to secure the traffic between the actions runner and the IIS server

## Example

```yml
...

jobs:
  create-iis-site:
   runs-on: [windows-2019]
   env:
      server: 'iis-server.domain.com'
      website-name: 'Default Website'
      apo-pool-name: 'website-pool'
      website-host-header: '*.defaultsite.com'
      website-path: 'c:\inetpub\wwwroot'
      website-cert-path: './src/site_cert.pfx'
      website-cert-password: '${{ secrets.site_cert_password }}'
      website-cert-friendly-name: '*.defaultsite.com'

   steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Create Web Site
        # You may also reference the major or major.minor version
        uses: im-open/iis-site-create@v3.0.3
        with:
          server: '${{ env.server }}'
          website-name: '${{ env.website-name }}'
          app-pool-name: '${{ env.app-pool-name }}'
          website-host-header: '${{ env.website-host-header}}'
          website-path: '${{ env.website-path }}'
          website-cert-path: '${{ env.website-cert-path }}'
          website-cert-password: '${{ env.website-cert-password }}'
          website-cert-friendly-name: '${{ env.website-cert-friendly-name }}'
          app-pool-service-account-id: '${{ env.APP_POOL_SA_ID }}'
          app-pool-service-account-secret: '${{ env.APP_POOL_SA_SECRET }}'
          deployment-service-account-id: '${{ secrets.DEPLOYMENT_SA_ID }}'
          deployment-service-account-secret: '${{ secrets.DEPLOYMENT_SA_SECRET }}'

...
```

## Contributing

When creating new PRs please ensure:

1. For major or minor changes, at least one of the commit messages contains the appropriate `+semver:` keywords listed under [Incrementing the Version](#incrementing-the-version).
1. The action code does not contain sensitive information.

When a pull request is created and there are changes to code-specific files and folders, the `auto-update-readme` workflow will run.  The workflow will update the action-examples in the README.md if they have not been updated manually by the PR author. The following files and folders contain action code and will trigger the automatic updates:

- `action.yml`
- `iis_action.ps1`

There may be some instances where the bot does not have permission to push changes back to the branch though so this step should be done manually for those branches. See [Incrementing the Version](#incrementing-the-version) for more details.

### Incrementing the Version

The `auto-update-readme` and PR merge workflows will use the strategies below to determine what the next version will be.  If the `auto-update-readme` workflow was not able to automatically update the README.md action-examples with the next version, the README.md should be updated manually as part of the PR using that calculated version.

This action uses [git-version-lite] to examine commit messages to determine whether to perform a major, minor or patch increment on merge. The following table provides the fragment that should be included in a commit message to active different increment strategies.
| Increment Type | Commit Message Fragment |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| major | +semver:breaking |
| major | +semver:major |
| minor | +semver:feature |
| minor | +semver:minor |
| patch | _default increment type, no comment needed_ |
